### ⚠️ Enabling Experimental Features

Experimental features can be enabled by manually setting the `experimental-features-enabled` key to `true` in your browser's local storage. Once enabled, you can press `Ctrl + E` (or `Super + E`) to open a dialog where you can toggle individual experimental features on or off.

This allows you to try out new and upcoming features before they are officially released. Please note that these features are in development and may be unstable.
