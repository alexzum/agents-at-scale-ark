# Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting guide for challenges when installing or using Ark.

## Ark Installation

This section covers common issues and solutions when installing Ark on various platforms.

### Prerequisites

Before installing Ark, ensure you have:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v18 or later)
- A Kubernetes cluster (e.g.,  [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), or [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/)).
- kubectl and Helm

The easiest way to install dependencies on macOS:

```bash
brew install node kubectl helm

# Install a cluster such as:
# brew install minikube
# brew install kind
# brew install orbstack
```

Verify your cluster context:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

### Installing Ark on Windows

Ark requires a Kubernetes cluster to run. There are a number of potential issues that can arise from permissions, organizational policies and so on, particularly around running Hypervisors (which is needed to run services like Docker and local Kubernetes clusters).

**WSL and Docker**

In most cases, you should install and enable [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with Ubuntu or another Linux distribution.

You should then install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). Hyper-V must be enabled. Enable Hyper-V and restart. Verify in "Task Manager" → "Performance" → "CPU" that "Virtualization" shows as "Enabled".

**Kubernetes Cluster**

Docker Desktop for Windows has Kubernetes support, go to wDocker Desktop Settings → Kubernetes → Enable Kubernetes.

Another option is [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) for Windows. Install and start with `minikube start`.

**Windows Installation Troubleshooting**

Many Windows installation issues stem from enterprise security policies and restricted environments. Potential issues are:

- Virtualization disabled - Hyper-V is often disabled by policy for security reasons
- Restricted user permissions - Standard users may not be able to modify system settings
- Security software - Endpoint protection may flag container operations as suspicious

**Node.js Installation Hangs**

Has been seen on some Windows installs. When the hang happens, terminate the installer, you can typically run `npm install -g @agents-at-scale/ark` and then install as normal, if not retry the Node.js installation.

**Missing Dependencies**

If `ark status` shows missing `kubectl` or `helm` then you local cluster is not setup, follow the guides above. The easiest way to install dependencies is via Chocolatey:

```bash
# Check system status
ark status
```

```powershell
# Install Chocolatey first (requires PowerShell as Administrator)
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Install the core dependencies.
choco install docker
choco install helm

# Install minikube if you want to use this as your cluster - this'll also install
# the kubectl binary.
choco install minikube

# Other cluster options are Kind and so on.
# choco install kind
```

**Minikube fails with "Hyper-V PowerShell Module is not available"**

Enable Hyper-V (requires restart):

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Tools-All -All
```

If the error persists after restart, check if your organization has a specific tool or process for enabling Hyper-V. May require BIOS-level virtualization to be enabled.

**Minikube "IP not found" Errors**

Update WSL, delete and recreate the minikube cluster:

```powershell
wsl --update
minikube delete
minikube start
```

If using Docker Desktop, ensure it's running with proper permissions

**Security Software Blocking Operations**

If you are unable to install Hyper-V, WSL2, Docker or Kubernetes you may need to work with your organizations IT department to request access to services.

**Download Failures**

Failed downloads, network errors, disconnects and so on for packages or installations can sometimes be due to corporate VPN issues, which may be able to be temporarily disabled.

**Avoiding Kubernetes on Windows**

If Kubernetes or Docker cannot be run in your environment, the best solution would be to run a remote Kubernetes cluster, on AWS/GCP or similar. Check the [Operations Guide](../../operations-guide/deploying-ark) on how to do this.

## Agents

**Agents without a model show as 'Unavailable'**

Agents created prior to version `v0.1.34` that do not have a model set may show as "Unavailable" or have events such as `ModelNotFound`.

To resolve, set the agent `modelRef` to `default`. See [v0.1.34 Upgrade Guide](/reference/upgrading#v0134) for more details.
