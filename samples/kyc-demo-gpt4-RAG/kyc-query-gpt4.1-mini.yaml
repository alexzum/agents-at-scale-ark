    Conduct a comprehensive KYC risk assessment for Associated British Foods PLC using GPT-4.1-mini.

    This assessment workflow should:

    - Leadership names extracted from additional data sources
    - Screening results analysis with confidence levels
    - Geographic and regulatory risk factors
    - Final risk rating (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with detailed justification
    - Specific recommendations for risk mitigation

    Focus on delivering:
    - A clear mission plan from the planner
    - A comprehensive RAG-enhanced risk assessment report from the risk officer
