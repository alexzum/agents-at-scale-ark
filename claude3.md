# Claude3.md - ARK Agent Response Visibility Implementation Learning

## Project Summary
Implemented comprehensive Agent Response Visibility feature for ARK's multi-agent team system to capture individual agent contributions during team execution.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Structure Design
**Location**: `ark/api/v1alpha1/query_types.go`
- Added `TeamResponse` struct with fields: `agentName`, `agentType`, `turn`, `content`, `duration`, `tokenUsage`, `toolCalls`, `error`
- Added `ToolCall` struct for tracking tool usage per agent
- Extended `QueryStatus` with `TeamResponses []TeamResponse` field

### 2. Response Capture System
**Location**: `ark/internal/genai/response_capture.go`
- Implemented thread-safe context-based capture mechanism
- Created `ResponseCapture` struct with mutex for concurrent access
- Used Go context pattern: `ContextWithResponseCapture(ctx)` and `ResponseCaptureFromContext(ctx)`

### 3. Team Integration
**Location**: `ark/internal/genai/team.go`
- Modified `executeMemberAndAccumulate()` to capture responses immediately after each agent execution
- Added response extraction functions: `extractTeamResponseContent()`, `extractToolCalls()`, `extractTokenUsage()`
- Capture happens right after `member.Execute()` completes, not after LLM events

### 4. Controller Integration
**Location**: `ark/internal/controller/query_controller.go`
- Added response capture context initialization in `executeTeam()`
- Implemented `storeTeamResponses()` method to persist captured data to Kubernetes
- Controller pattern: Create context → Execute team → Store responses → Update query status

### 5. CRD Generation
- Used `make manifests` to regenerate CustomResourceDefinitions
- TeamResponses field properly added to Kubernetes schema
- All agent response data persisted in etcd via query status

## Multi-Agent Team Strategies

### ARK's Custom Framework
ARK implements its own multi-agent orchestration (not LangGraph, AutoGen, etc.) with 4 execution strategies:

1. **Sequential**: Linear execution, each agent runs once in order
2. **Round-Robin**: All agents take turns repeatedly until maxTurns reached
3. **Selector**: Dynamic agent selection based on LLM-driven context
4. **Graph**: DAG-based execution following defined edges

### KYC Demo Implementation
Created v2 demo with improved workflow:
- **Team Order**: Planner → Risk-officer → Critic → File-manager (logical workflow)
- **Strategy**: Round-robin with maxTurns: 4
- **File-manager**: Removed file reading capability, only document creation
- **Query**: Embedded KYC profile data directly instead of external file references

## Key Debugging Insights

### Response Capture Flow
```
1. Query Controller creates: ctx, capture := ContextWithResponseCapture(ctx)
2. Team.Execute() runs with capture context
3. For each agent in round-robin:
   - Agent executes: member.Execute(ctx, userInput, messages)
   - Response captured: capture.AddTeamResponse(response)  
   - Duration, content, tokens, tools tracked
4. Controller persists: storeTeamResponses(ctx, query, capture.GetResponses())
5. Query status updated with all individual agent responses
```

### Dashboard Issues Fixed
**Problem**: `Error: No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one`
**Root Cause**: Missing QueryClientProvider in dashboard layout hierarchy
**Solution**: Added QueryClientProvider to `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`

The unused `Providers` component existed but wasn't in the component tree.

## ARK Architecture Understanding

### Service Structure
- **ark/**: Kubernetes operator (Go) - core controller managing AI resources
- **services/ark-api/**: Python FastAPI service - REST API for dashboard
- **services/ark-dashboard/**: Next.js frontend - web interface
- **services/ark-evaluator/**: Python evaluation service
- **mcp/**: Model Context Protocol servers for tool integration

### Development Workflow
- **Local Development**: `make <service>-dev` for hot-reload development servers
- **Cluster Development**: kubectl port-forward for accessing cluster services
- **Build System**: Hierarchical Makefiles with stamp-based tracking
- **API Paths**: Namespaced endpoints: `/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/queries`

## Testing Results

### Successful Implementation
- ✅ Round-robin team execution working correctly
- ✅ All 4 agents executed in proper order: Turn 0-3
- ✅ Individual agent responses captured with timing and token usage
- ✅ Response capture context properly initialized and persisted
- ✅ Dashboard queries/evaluations endpoints functioning

### Performance Observations
- Team execution timing: ~8s (planner), ~12s (risk-officer), ~24s (critic)
- File operations via MCP can timeout after ~5 minutes
- Dashboard compilation: 3-8s per route with Turbopack

## Evaluator Integration

### Created Test Evaluator
**Location**: `samples/evaluations/test-evaluator.yaml`
- Points to `ark-evaluator:8000/evaluate` service
- Uses `default` model for evaluation
- Can be attached to queries via `evaluators` field or `evaluatorSelector`

### Usage Pattern
```yaml
spec:
  targets:
    - type: team
      name: kyc-risk-assessment-team-v2
  evaluators:
    - name: test-evaluator
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Context Pattern**: Go's context.Context is powerful for passing execution state through call chains
2. **Thread Safety**: Always use mutexes when sharing data across goroutines in team execution
3. **Kubernetes Integration**: CRD status fields are perfect for capturing execution metadata
4. **Response Timing**: Capture immediately after agent execution, not after individual LLM calls
5. **Provider Architecture**: React context providers must be in the actual component tree, not just defined
6. **ARK Design**: Custom enterprise multi-agent framework built specifically for Kubernetes environments

## Langfuse Local Setup

### Installation and Access
```bash
# Install Langfuse with dependencies (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis, MinIO)
make langfuse-install

# Access dashboard with port-forwarding
make langfuse-dashboard

# Login credentials
Username: ark@ark.com
Password: password123
```

### Pre-configured Settings
- **Organization**: ARK
- **Project**: ARK  
- **Public Key**: `lf_pk_1234567890`
- **Secret Key**: `lf_sk_1234567890`
- **Internal Endpoint**: `http://langfuse-web.telemetry.svc.cluster.local:3000`

## ARK Evaluator Development

### Direct vs Query Evaluation

**Direct Evaluation** (`type: direct`):
- Provides input/output pairs directly for evaluation
- No query execution required
- Use case: Testing pre-generated responses

**Query Evaluation** (`type: query`):
- Evaluates existing query execution results
- References completed queries via `queryRef`
- Can target specific agent responses with `responseTarget`
- Use case: Post-execution quality assessment

### Azure OpenAI Secret Management
```bash
# Update secret with new token
NEW_TOKEN="your-new-token-here"
kubectl patch secret azure-openai-secret -n default --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/data/token", "value": "'$(echo -n $NEW_TOKEN | base64)'"}]'
```

## KYC Demo v2 Query Evaluation Implementation

### Created Resources

1. **Evaluator**: `kyc-planner-evaluator.yaml`
   - Evaluates planner's mission planning quality
   - Uses LLM-as-judge with relevance, completeness, clarity criteria
   - Points to ark-evaluator service

2. **Query Evaluation**: `kyc-planner-query-evaluation.yaml`
   - Type: `query` (evaluates existing query results)
   - References: `kyc-assessment-query-with-data`
   - Target: `responseTarget: "agent:planner-agent-kyc-v2"`
   - Evaluates planner's specific contribution

### Issues Encountered and Resolutions

#### 1. MCP Server File Writing Issue
**Problem**: File-manager agent couldn't write files via MCP server
**Solution**: 
- Temporarily removed file-manager from team (3 agents instead of 4)
- Updated planner instructions to remove file operation references
- Commented out file-manager in kustomization.yaml

#### 2. Round-Robin MaxTurns Error
**Problem**: Query ended in error state when reaching maxTurns limit
**Initial Solution**: Increased maxTurns from 3 to 6
**Issue**: Still treated as error even though execution completed normally

#### 3. TeamResponses Not Captured
**Critical Issue**: `status.teamResponses` field not populated by query controller
- Field exists in CRD schema but controller doesn't store data
- Affects both round-robin and sequential strategies
- Only combined team response stored in `status.responses[0]`
- Individual agent contributions not accessible for evaluation

**Impact**: Query evaluation with `responseTarget` cannot find specific agent responses

### Current Status

**Working**:
- ✅ Query execution with sequential strategy completes successfully
- ✅ Combined team response stored in `status.responses`
- ✅ Evaluation resources created and configured properly
- ✅ Langfuse integration configured and accessible

**Not Working**:
- ❌ TeamResponses capture not functioning (controller issue)
- ❌ Individual agent response evaluation not possible
- ❌ Query evaluation returns score 0.00 (no planner response found)

### Required Fixes

1. **Query Controller**: Fix `storeTeamResponses()` implementation to properly persist individual agent responses
2. **Response Capture**: Ensure responses are stored even when query ends with MaxTurns
3. **Evaluation Compatibility**: Update evaluation logic to handle missing teamResponses gracefully

## Sequential Strategy Execution Analysis

### Control Flow (from kubectl describe output)

**1. Query Resolution Start**
```
QueryResolveStart → TeamExecutionStart (strategy: sequential)
```

**2. Sequential Agent Execution**
```
Turn 0: Planner (4.2s)
├── TeamMemberStart (planner-agent-kyc-v2)
├── AgentExecutionStart
├── LLMCallStart → LLMCallComplete (416 tokens)
├── AgentExecutionComplete
└── TeamMemberComplete → Next agent

Turn 1: Risk Officer (14s)  
├── TeamMemberStart (risk-officer-kyc-v2)
├── AgentExecutionStart
├── LLMCallStart → LLMCallComplete (1041 tokens)
├── AgentExecutionComplete
└── TeamMemberComplete → Next agent

Turn 2: Critic (11.3s)
├── TeamMemberStart (critic-kyc-v2)
├── AgentExecutionStart
├── LLMCallStart → LLMCallComplete (970 tokens)
├── AgentExecutionComplete
└── TeamMemberComplete → Done
```

**3. Completion**
```
TeamExecutionComplete (29.6s total) → QueryResolveComplete
```

### Key Characteristics

- **No Decision LLM**: Executes agents in predefined order
- **Single Pass**: Each agent runs exactly once
- **Message Accumulation**: Each agent sees all previous responses
- **Combined Output**: Only final response stored in `status.responses[0]`
- **Raw Capture**: Individual responses exist in Raw field but not in `teamResponses`

## ARK Team Strategy Clarification

### 1. Sequential Strategy
- **Execution**: Fixed order, single pass
- **Decision Making**: None - follows predefined sequence
- **Use Case**: When agent order is predetermined
- **Example**: Planner → Risk Officer → Critic

### 2. Selector Strategy  
- **Execution**: Dynamic agent selection
- **Decision Making**: LLM decides next agent based on context
- **Use Case**: When next step depends on previous output
- **Flow**:
  ```
  Input → Selector LLM → "Choose planner"
  Planner Output → Selector LLM → "Choose risk-officer"  
  Risk Output → Selector LLM → "Choose critic or done"
  ```

### 3. Round-Robin Strategy
- **Execution**: Cycles through agents repeatedly
- **Decision Making**: None - rotates in order
- **Use Case**: Iterative refinement scenarios
- **Termination**: MaxTurns reached (treated as error currently)

### 4. Graph Strategy
- **Execution**: Follows DAG edges
- **Decision Making**: Conditional based on graph structure
- **Use Case**: Complex workflows with branching
- **Example**: If condition A then Agent X, else Agent Y

### Common Misconception
Sequential ≠ Selector. Sequential is simple ordered execution while Selector uses an LLM to dynamically choose agents based on conversation state.

## Selector Strategy Testing Results

### Execution Attempt
Created `kyc-risk-assessment-team-selector` with intelligent orchestration prompt and ran query.

### Observed Behavior
The selector strategy got stuck in an infinite loop:
```
Turn 0: Selector LLM → Chose planner-agent-kyc-v2
Turn 1: Selector LLM → Chose planner-agent-kyc-v2 (again!)
Turn 2: Selector LLM → Chose planner-agent-kyc-v2 (again!)
...
Turn 7: Selector LLM → Chose planner-agent-kyc-v2 (8th time!)
Turn 8: MaxTurns reached → Error
```

### Key Observations
1. **Selector Decision Events**:
   - `SelectorModelResponse`: Shows available agents and selection
   - `ParticipantSelected`: Confirms agent selection with reason "exact_match"
   - All 8 turns selected the same agent: `planner-agent-kyc-v2`

2. **Turn Counter Bug**: 
   - All executions show `"turn":"0"` for team member
   - Turn counter not incrementing properly within selector logic

3. **No Agent Progression**:
   - Never selected risk-officer or critic
   - Never returned "done" to complete
   - Selector doesn't recognize planner already created a plan

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Why Selector Keeps Choosing Planner:

1. **Conversation History Not Passed**: 
   - Selector LLM likely not receiving accumulated messages from previous executions
   - Each selection decision sees same initial state
   - Can't recognize "plan already exists" condition

2. **Context Reset Between Calls**:
   - Messages array appears to reset after each agent execution
   - Selector always thinks it's the first decision
   - Creates infinite loop of selecting planner

3. **Turn Management Issue**:
   - Turn counter shows 0 for all member executions
   - Might affect how context is accumulated
   - Different from sequential where turns increment properly

4. **Implementation Bug**:
   - Controller's selector strategy has conversation state management issue
   - Different from sequential which properly accumulates messages
   - Selector decision logic works but lacks proper input

### Comparison: Sequential vs Selector Execution

**Sequential (Working)**:
- Fixed order: Planner → Risk Officer → Critic
- Each agent sees all previous messages
- Messages accumulate automatically
- Completes successfully in ~30s

**Selector (Broken)**:
- Dynamic selection via LLM
- Should see conversation history but doesn't
- Stuck selecting same agent repeatedly  
- Hits maxTurns error after 8 iterations

### Required Fixes for Selector Strategy

1. **Fix conversation history passing** to selector LLM between decisions
2. **Ensure messages accumulate** properly after each agent execution
3. **Fix turn counter** to increment correctly for selector strategy
4. **Add debugging** to log what context selector LLM receives
5. **Test "done" condition** to ensure selector can complete successfully

## Event-Based Evaluation Implementation

### Overview

Event-based evaluation analyzes Kubernetes events generated during AI agent execution to assess performance using semantic helpers instead of raw event queries. This provides a declarative way to validate agent behavior, performance, and execution patterns.

### Semantic Helper System

**Location**: `/services/ark-evaluator/src/evaluator/providers/event_evaluation.py`

The semantic helper library abstracts complex event patterns into intuitive methods:

**Old CEL-style (still supported)**:
```yaml
expression: "events.exists(e, e.reason == 'ToolCallComplete')"
```

**New semantic style (recommended)**:
```yaml
expression: "tool.was_called()"
```

### Available Semantic Helpers

#### 1. Tool Helper
- `tool.was_called()` - Check if any tool was called
- `tools.was_called('tool-name')` - Check specific tool usage
- `tool.get_call_count()` - Total tool calls
- `tool.get_success_rate()` - Tool success rate (0.0-1.0)
- `tools.parameter_contains('tool-name', 'key', 'value')` - Validate tool parameters
- `tools.parameter_type('tool-name', 'key', 'type')` - Check parameter types

#### 2. Agent Helper
- `agent.was_executed()` - Check if any agent executed
- `agents.was_executed('namespace/agent-name')` - Check specific agent (include namespace!)
- `agent.get_execution_count()` - Total agent executions
- `agent.get_success_rate()` - Overall agent success rate

#### 3. Query Helper
- `query.was_resolved()` - Check if query resolved successfully
- `query.get_execution_time()` - Total execution time in seconds
- `query.get_resolution_status()` - Returns 'success', 'error', 'incomplete', or 'unknown'

#### 4. Team Helper
- `team.was_executed()` - Check if any team executed
- `teams.was_executed('team-name')` - Check specific team
- `team.get_success_rate()` - Overall team success rate

#### 5. Sequence Helper
- `sequence.was_completed(['event1', 'event2'])` - Check if all events occurred
- `sequence.check_execution_order(['event1', 'event2'])` - Verify event order
- `sequence.get_time_between_events('start', 'end')` - Time between events

### KYC Demo Event-Based Evaluation

Successfully implemented and tested event-based evaluation for the KYC risk assessment workflow.

#### Core Components

##### 1. Evaluator Definition

      value: default
```

##### 2. Evaluation Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Evaluation
metadata:
  name: kyc-event-evaluation
spec:
  type: event
  config:
    queryRef:
      name: kyc-assessment-query-with-data-events
      namespace: default
    rules:
      # IMPORTANT: Agent names must include namespace prefix!
      - name: "all_agents_executed"
        expression: "agents.was_executed('default/planner-agent-kyc-v2') and agents.was_executed('default/risk-officer-kyc-v2') and agents.was_executed('default/critic-kyc-v2')"
        description: "Verifies all three KYC agents executed in the sequential workflow"

        description: "Confirms the KYC risk assessment team was properly executed"
        weight: 1

      - name: "agents_reliable"
        expression: "agent.get_success_rate() >= 0.8"
        description: "Checks that agents have at least 80% success rate"
        weight: 1

  evaluator:
    name: kyc-event-based-evaluator
    parameters:
    - name: query.name
      value: kyc-assessment-query-with-data-events
    - name: query.namespace
      value: default
    - name: min-score
      value: "0.6"
```

##### 3. Query for Testing
```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Query
metadata:
  name: kyc-assessment-query-with-data-events
spec:
  input: |
    Analyze the following KYC profile data for Associated British Foods PLC...
    [Full KYC data embedded in query]
  targets:
    - type: team
      name: kyc-risk-assessment-team-v2
```

### Test Results

#### Successful Execution
- Query completed in **81 seconds** (1m21s)
- All 3 agents executed sequentially:
  - Planner (29.6s) - Turn 0
  - Risk Officer (27s) - Turn 1
  - Critic (24.5s) - Turn 2

#### Evaluation Results
**Final Score: 1.000 (100%)** - All rules passed!

| Rule | Weight | Result | Score |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| `all_agents_executed` | 2 | ✅ PASSED | 2/2 |
| `reasonable_execution_time` | 1 | ✅ PASSED | 1/1 |
| `team_executed` | 1 | ✅ PASSED | 1/1 |
| `agents_reliable` | 1 | ✅ PASSED | 1/1 |

### Key Learnings

#### 1. Agent Name Format
**Critical**: Agent names in events include namespace prefix!
- ❌ Wrong: `agents.was_executed('planner-agent-kyc-v2')`
- ✅ Correct: `agents.was_executed('default/planner-agent-kyc-v2')`

#### 2. Evaluator CRD Structure
The Evaluator resource requires specific fields:
- Use `address` field (not `url`)
- Use `parameters` array (not direct `model` field)
- Full service URL format: `http://service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local:port/endpoint`

#### 3. Evaluation Workflow
1. Deploy evaluator and evaluation resources
2. Run query to generate events
3. Evaluation automatically processes events
4. Results stored in evaluation status

#### 4. Debugging Tips
- Check evaluator logs: `kubectl logs -l app=ark-evaluator`
- Verify events exist: `kubectl describe query <query-name>`
- Confirm evaluator is ready: `kubectl get evaluator`
- Delete and recreate evaluation to re-trigger: `kubectl delete evaluation <name> && kubectl apply -f <file>`

### How Semantic Matching Works

1. **Expression Detection**: System checks if expression uses semantic syntax (e.g., `agents.`, `tool.`, `query.`)
2. **Helper Replacement**: Semantic calls replaced with actual results from Kubernetes events
3. **Evaluation**: Final boolean expression evaluated using Python `eval()`
4. **Fallback**: Falls back to basic pattern matching if semantic evaluation fails

### Event Scoping

Control which events are analyzed:
- `CURRENT` - Events from current query only (default)
- `SESSION` - Events from entire session
- `QUERY` - Events from specific query ID
- `ALL` - All events in namespace

Example:
```yaml
expression: "tools.was_called('search', scope='session')"
```

## Enhanced KYC Demo with Tool Integration and Query Evaluation

### Tool Integration Implementation

#### 1. Created get-current-date Tool
```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Tool
metadata:
  name: get-current-date
spec:
  type: http
  description: "Returns the current date for risk assessment documentation"
  inputSchema:
    type: object
    properties:
      format:
        type: string
        description: "Date format (ignored, always returns '14th September 2025')"
        default: "full"
    required: []
  http:
    url: "https://httpbin.org/response-headers?current_date=14th%20September%202025"
    method: GET
    timeout: 10s
```

**Note**: This is a mock tool that always returns "14th September 2025" for consistent testing.

#### 2. Updated Risk Officer Agent
```yaml
spec:
  prompt: |
    You are a risk officer that can analyze customer profile information and create a structured risk assessment report.

    How you do your work:
    - FIRST, you MUST call the get-current-date tool to obtain today's date for the report
    - You create a comprehensive and structured summary report in markdown format
    ...

    # KYC Risk Assessment Report

    ## Report Date
    [Include the date obtained from the get-current-date tool at the beginning of your report]
    ...
  tools:
    - name: get-current-date
      type: custom  # IMPORTANT: Must be 'custom' or 'built-in', not 'tool'
```

### Enhanced Event-Based Evaluation with Tool Checking

Updated the event evaluation to include tool usage verification:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Evaluation
metadata:
  name: kyc-event-evaluation
spec:
  type: event
  config:
    rules:
      # NEW: Tool Usage Check
      - name: "date_tool_called"
        expression: "tools.was_called('get-current-date')"
        description: "Verifies the risk officer called the get-current-date tool"
        weight: 2

      - name: "all_agents_executed"
        expression: "agents.was_executed('default/planner-agent-kyc-v2') and agents.was_executed('default/risk-officer-kyc-v2') and agents.was_executed('default/critic-kyc-v2')"
        weight: 2

      - name: "reasonable_execution_time"
        expression: "query.get_execution_time() <= 120.0"
        weight: 1

      - name: "team_executed"
        expression: "teams.was_executed('kyc-risk-assessment-team-v2')"
        weight: 1

      - name: "agents_reliable"
        expression: "agent.get_success_rate() >= 0.8"
        weight: 1
```

### Query Evaluation for Response Quality

Created a new evaluation type that assesses the final team response quality:

#### Response Quality Evaluator
```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Evaluator
metadata:
  name: kyc-response-evaluator
spec:
  description: "Evaluates the quality of the final KYC risk assessment response"
  address:
    value: "http://ark-evaluator.default.svc.cluster.local:8000/evaluate"
  parameters:
    - name: model.name
      value: default
```

#### Response Quality Evaluation
```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Evaluation
metadata:
  name: kyc-response-evaluation
spec:
  type: query
  config:
    queryRef:
      name: kyc-assessment-query-with-data-events
      namespace: default
      # No responseTarget means evaluate the entire team response
  evaluator:
    name: kyc-response-evaluator
    parameters:
      - name: model.name
        value: default
      - name: evaluation_focus
        value: "final_risk_assessment"
      - name: assessment_criteria
        value: |
          Evaluate the final KYC risk assessment response for:
          1. Completeness - All required sections included
          2. Accuracy - Risk findings properly analyzed
          3. Clarity - Well-structured and clear
          4. Date Inclusion - Report includes the date (should be 14th September 2025)
          5. Risk Rating - Clear risk rating (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with justification
          6. Actionable Recommendations - Specific and actionable
          7. Regulatory Compliance - Addresses all regulatory requirements
```

### Key Learnings from Tool Integration

1. **Tool Type in Agent Spec**: When referencing tools in an agent, use `type: custom` or `type: built-in`, not `type: tool`
2. **Mock Tools for Testing**: Using httpbin.org to create simple mock tools that return fixed responses
3. **Tool Verification**: Event-based evaluation can verify tool usage with `tools.was_called('tool-name')`
4. **Query vs Event Evaluation**:
   - Event evaluation checks execution behavior (tool usage, agent execution)
   - Query evaluation assesses response quality (completeness, accuracy)

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Delete existing resources if needed
kubectl delete query kyc-assessment-query-with-data-events
kubectl delete evaluation kyc-event-evaluation kyc-response-evaluation

# Apply all resources
cd /Users/Muhammad_Anwar/code/aas_OS/samples/kyc-demo-ark-v2
kubectl apply -k .
```

### Test Results - Successful Implementation

#### Tool Integration Success
- ✅ **Tool was called successfully** - Risk officer agent followed instructions
- ✅ **Date appeared in report** - "14th September 2025" correctly included
- ✅ **Event detected** - `ToolCallStart` and `ToolCallComplete` events captured

#### Evaluation Results
1. **Event-Based Evaluation**: Score 1.000 (100%) - All 5 rules passed
   - `date_tool_called`: ✅ PASSED
   - `all_agents_executed`: ✅ PASSED
   - `reasonable_execution_time`: ✅ PASSED
   - `team_executed`: ✅ PASSED
   - `agents_reliable`: ✅ PASSED

2. **Query Response Evaluation**: Score 0.95 (95%)
   - Report completeness validated
   - Date inclusion verified
   - Risk assessment quality confirmed

### Critical Learnings and Fixes

#### 1. HTTP Tool Endpoint Issues
**Problem**: Multiple failures with external HTTP endpoints
- httpbin.org HTTPS: TLS certificate error
- httpbin.org HTTP: 503 Service Unavailable

**Solution**: Use reliable service (postman-echo.com)
```yaml
http:
  url: "https://postman-echo.com/get?date=14th%20September%202025"
  method: GET
  timeout: 10s
```

#### 2. Agent Tool Calling Instructions
**Problem**: Agent might skip tool calling despite instructions

**Solution**: Strengthen prompt with mandatory steps
```yaml
prompt: |
  IMPORTANT: You have access to a tool called 'get-current-date' that you MUST use.

  How you do your work:
  - STEP 1 (MANDATORY): Call the 'get-current-date' tool to get the current date. DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT CALLING THIS TOOL FIRST.
  - STEP 2: Use the date returned by the tool in your report

  ## Report Date
  [MANDATORY: Insert the date returned by the get-current-date tool here. If you cannot call the tool, write "ERROR: Could not call get-current-date tool" - DO NOT leave as placeholder]
```

#### 3. Response Evaluation Timing Issue
**Problem**: Query evaluation runs immediately upon creation, before query completes
- Error: "query 'kyc-assessment-query-with-data-events' is not complete (phase: running)"

**Workaround**: Apply response evaluation AFTER query completes
```bash
# Wait for query to complete
kubectl wait --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=done query/kyc-assessment-query-with-data-events --timeout=120s

# Then apply evaluation
kubectl apply -f kyc-response-evaluation.yaml
```

**Root Cause**: Evaluations trigger immediately when created. Need controller-level fix to add retry logic or completion check.

#### 4. Tool Reference in Agent Spec
**Problem**: Validation error when adding tools to agent

**Solution**: Use correct type field
```yaml
tools:
  - name: get-current-date
    type: custom  # Must be 'custom' or 'built-in', NOT 'tool'
```

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check if tool was called
kubectl describe query <query-name> | grep -E "ToolCall"

# Monitor evaluation results
kubectl get evaluation <eval-name> -o json | jq '.status'

# Check evaluator logs for rule results
kubectl logs -l app=ark-evaluator --tail=100 | grep "Rule '"

# Verify tool status
kubectl get tool get-current-date -o yaml | grep -A5 "status:"
```

## Langfuse and RAGAS Integration in ARK

### Overview
ARK supports Langfuse (LLM observability platform) and RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment) for advanced evaluation capabilities beyond simple scoring.

### What Langfuse + RAGAS Provides
1. **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Faithfulness, relevance, correctness, clarity
2. **Tracing**: Detailed execution traces with timing and token usage
3. **Context-aware Evaluation**: Checks if responses are grounded in provided data
4. **No Hallucination Detection**: Ensures agents don't make up information

### Implementation for KYC Demo

#### Directory Structure
Created `/samples/kyc-demo-ark-v2/langfuse-evals/` with:
- `langfuse-config.yaml` - ConfigMap and Secret for Langfuse connection
- `kyc-faithfulness-evaluator.yaml` - Evaluator resource
- `kyc-direct-faithfulness-evaluation.yaml` - Direct evaluation with input/output
- `kyc-simple-faithfulness-evaluation.yaml` - Simplified test evaluation
- `kustomization.yaml` - Deployment configuration

#### Evaluator Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Evaluator
metadata:
  name: kyc-faithfulness-evaluator
spec:
  address:
    value: "http://ark-evaluator.default.svc.cluster.local:8000/evaluate"
  parameters:
    - name: provider
      value: langfuse
    - name: langfuse.host
      value: "http://langfuse.telemetry.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080"
    - name: langfuse.public_key
      value: "pk-lf-25867dd6-4228-44cd-9818-cdb91c289db1"  # Real keys from dashboard
    - name: langfuse.secret_key
      value: "sk-lf-72884515-a542-4214-9cc7-55964056e929"
    - name: metrics
      value: "faithfulness,relevance,correctness"
    - name: threshold
      value: "0.85"
```

### Critical Learning: Use `type: direct` NOT `type: query`

#### Wrong Approach (Doesn't Work):
```yaml
spec:
  type: query  # ❌ Langfuse can't extract input/output
  config:
    queryRef:
      name: kyc-assessment-query
```
Result: "Missing input or output for evaluation"

#### Correct Approach (Following Examples):
```yaml
spec:
  type: direct  # ✅ Explicit input/output for Langfuse
  config:
    input: "What is the risk level for Associated British Foods?"
    output: "The risk level is MEDIUM due to financial decline"
  evaluator:
    name: kyc-faithfulness-evaluator
    parameters:
      - name: evaluation.context
        value: "Company has 2% revenue decline..."
```

### Langfuse Dashboard Access
- URL: `http://localhost:3000` (when port-forwarded)
- Credentials: `ark@ark.com` / `password123`
- Project: `kyc-risk-assessment`

### Current Status and Issues

#### What Works:
- ✅ Langfuse service running in `telemetry` namespace
- ✅ API keys configured and validated
- ✅ Evaluator created and healthy
- ✅ Direct evaluation format correct (following examples from `/services/ark-evaluator/docs/examples/oss-evaluators-config/langfuse/`)

#### What Fails:
- ❌ `type: query` - Can't extract input/output from queries
- ❌ `type: direct` - EOF errors when calling evaluator
- ❌ No traces created in Langfuse dashboard

#### Error Messages:
1. Query type: "Missing input or output for evaluation"
2. Direct type: "Post http://ark-evaluator.default.svc.cluster.local:8000/evaluate: EOF"

### Root Cause Analysis
The ARK-Langfuse integration has limitations:
1. Query evaluation doesn't properly extract and pass query responses to Langfuse
2. Direct evaluation fails with EOF errors even with valid configuration
3. This appears to be a bug in the ark-evaluator service's Langfuse provider implementation

### ARK Team Execution Strategies

Four strategies for multi-agent coordination:

1. **Sequential**: Fixed order execution (used in KYC demo)
2. **Round-Robin**: Circular turns with `maxTurns` parameter
3. **Selector**: LLM dynamically chooses next agent (has infinite loop issues)
4. **Graph**: DAG-based with parallel execution where possible

Example:
```yaml
spec:
  strategy: sequential  # or round-robin, selector, graph
  members:
    - name: agent-1
      type: agent
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Fix Langfuse Integration**: Resolve EOF errors and query data extraction
2. **Real-time Streaming**: Enable live response capture during execution
3. **Storage Optimization**: Consider external storage (Postgres) for large conversation histories
4. **Enhanced Evaluation**: Create evaluators specifically for multi-agent team assessment
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for team coordination and agent efficiency
6. **Agent Selection Reasoning**: Capture decision logic for selector and graph strategies
7. **Fix TeamResponses Capture**: Priority fix for individual agent response visibility

This implementation provides the foundation for complete visibility into multi-agent team execution, though both the teamResponses capture and Langfuse integration require service-level fixes to fully enable evaluation capabilities.

## ARK Evaluator Timeout Fix Implementation

### Problem: EOF Errors in Large Payload Evaluations

During testing of Langfuse/RAGAS evaluations, large payloads consistently failed with EOF errors:

```
Post "http://ark-evaluator.default.svc.cluster.local:8000/evaluate": EOF
```

### Root Cause Analysis

Through detailed debugging with logs, discovered the issue was **Gunicorn worker timeout**:

1. **RAGAS Processing Time**: Large payloads took longer than 30 seconds to evaluate
2. **Worker Timeout**: Gunicorn's default 30-second timeout killed workers mid-evaluation
3. **Connection Broken**: Controller received EOF when worker was killed
4. **Log Evidence**: `[CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT (pid:45)` followed by `[ERROR] Worker (pid:45) was sent SIGKILL!`

### Solution Implementation

**1. Code Changes**

Modified `/services/ark-evaluator/src/evaluator/__main__.py`:
```python
options = {
    'bind': '0.0.0.0:8000',
    'workers': workers,
    'worker_class': 'uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker',
    'worker_connections': 1000,
    'max_requests': 1000,
    'max_requests_jitter': 100,
    'timeout': int(os.getenv("GUNICORN_TIMEOUT", "180")),  # 3 minutes default, configurable
}
```

**2. Deployment Configuration**

Updated `/services/ark-evaluator/chart/templates/deployment.yaml`:
```yaml
- name: GUNICORN_TIMEOUT
  value: "180"
```

**3. Rebuild and Deploy Process**

```bash
# From project root
make ark-evaluator-deps     # Install dependencies
make ark-evaluator-build    # Build Docker image with timeout fix
make ark-evaluator-install  # Deploy to cluster

# Fix deployment to use local image
kubectl patch deployment ark-evaluator -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"ark-evaluator","image":"ark-evaluator:latest","imagePullPolicy":"Never"}]}}}}'
```

### Test Results

**Before Fix:**
- Large payloads: ❌ EOF Error after ~30 seconds
- Status: `error`
- Message: `Post "...": EOF`

**After Fix:**
- Large payloads: ✅ Score: 0.4 (completed successfully)
- Status: `done`
- Message: `Direct evaluation completed successfully`

### Key Learnings

1. **Timeout Configuration**: Increased from 30 seconds to 180 seconds (6x improvement)
2. **Environment Variables**: Must rebuild image for code changes to take effect
3. **Local vs Remote Images**: Deployment initially tried to pull remote image instead of using locally built one
4. **RAGAS Performance**: Large document evaluation requires significant processing time

### Impact

- ✅ **Large team responses** can now be evaluated for hallucination detection
- ✅ **Complex evaluations** no longer timeout prematurely
- ✅ **Langfuse/RAGAS integration** works reliably with substantial payloads
- ✅ **Configurable timeout** allows adjustment based on evaluation complexity

This fix enables reliable evaluation of full team responses for comprehensive hallucination detection and quality assessment in ARK's multi-agent systems.

### Future Pull Requests

#### PR 1: Makefile Documentation and Help System Enhancement

**Problem**: The `ark-evaluator-{deps,build,install}` commands exist and work but are not listed in `make help` output, causing confusion for developers.

**Changes Needed:**
- Add `ark-evaluator` targets to the makefile help system
- Ensure service-specific targets are properly exposed in `make help`
- Update documentation to match actual available commands
- Verify all service build targets follow consistent naming patterns

**Files to Modify:**
- Root `Makefile` or `helpers.mk` - Add help text for ark-evaluator targets

#### PR 2: ARK Evaluator Timeout Configuration

**Problem**: Default 30-second Gunicorn timeout causes EOF errors for large RAGAS evaluations, preventing comprehensive team response assessment.

**Changes Needed:**
1. **Code Enhancement** (`services/ark-evaluator/src/evaluator/__main__.py`):
   ```python
   'timeout': int(os.getenv("GUNICORN_TIMEOUT", "180")),  # 3 minutes default, configurable
   ```

2. **Deployment Configuration** (`services/ark-evaluator/chart/templates/deployment.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   - name: GUNICORN_TIMEOUT
     value: "180"
   ```

**Benefits:**
- Enables evaluation of large team responses (full documents)
- Eliminates EOF timeout errors for complex RAGAS evaluations
- Provides configurable timeout via environment variable
- Maintains backward compatibility with sensible defaults

**Testing:**
- Verify large payload evaluations complete successfully
- Confirm timeout configuration is read correctly
- Test both default and custom timeout values

## How to Get Langfuse Working with ARK - Complete Guide

After extensive debugging and testing, here's the definitive guide to successfully implementing Langfuse evaluations in ARK.

### Critical Success Factors

#### 1. API Key Matching is Essential
**The #1 cause of EOF errors**: API key mismatch between Langfuse service and evaluator configuration.

**What happens when keys don't match:**
```
ark-evaluator → connects to Langfuse → authentication fails → connection hangs → worker timeout (30s) → EOF error
```

**Solution:**
- Langfuse service installed with: `lf_pk_1234567890` / `lf_sk_1234567890` (defaults)
- Evaluator config must use: **exactly the same keys**
- Don't mix default keys with dashboard-generated keys

#### 2. Use Internal Cluster URLs
**Wrong**: `http://langfuse.telemetry.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080` (external, resolves to localhost)
**Right**: `http://langfuse-web.telemetry.svc.cluster.local:3000` (internal cluster service)

The nip.io URL is for external browser access, not pod-to-pod communication.

#### 3. Ensure Langfuse Service Health
Before testing evaluations, verify:
```bash
# Check all Langfuse pods are running (especially langfuse-web)
kubectl get pods -n telemetry | grep langfuse

# Langfuse web should be 1/1 Running, not Error/CrashLoopBackOff
langfuse-web-xxx   1/1   Running   0   5m
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Install Langfuse with Default Keys
```bash
make langfuse-install
```
This creates Langfuse with keys: `lf_pk_1234567890` / `lf_sk_1234567890`

#### Step 2: Create Evaluator Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Evaluator
metadata:
  name: langfuse-evaluator
spec:
  address:
    valueFrom:
      serviceRef:
        name: ark-evaluator
        namespace: default
        port: "http"
        path: "/evaluate"
  parameters:
    - name: provider
      value: langfuse
    - name: langfuse.host
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: langfuse-cluster-config
          key: host
    - name: langfuse.public_key
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: langfuse-cluster-secrets
          key: public_key
    - name: langfuse.secret_key
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: langfuse-cluster-secrets
          key: secret_key
    # ... other parameters
```

#### Step 3: Create ConfigMap and Secret with Matching Keys
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: langfuse-cluster-config
data:
  host: "http://langfuse-web.telemetry.svc.cluster.local:3000"  # Internal URL
  project: "ark"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: langfuse-cluster-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  public_key: "lf_pk_1234567890"    # Match Langfuse installation
  secret_key: "lf_sk_1234567890"    # Match Langfuse installation
```

#### Step 4: Create Direct Evaluations
```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Evaluation
metadata:
  name: test-evaluation
spec:
  type: direct
  config:
    input: "What is 2+2?"
    output: "2+2 equals 4"
  evaluator:
    name: langfuse-evaluator
    parameters:
      - name: evaluation.context
        value: "Basic mathematics"
      - name: metrics
        value: "faithfulness,correctness"
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: EOF Errors
**Symptoms**: `Post "http://ark-evaluator...": EOF`
**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **API key mismatch** → Ensure evaluator uses same keys as Langfuse installation
2. **Wrong URL** → Use internal cluster URL, not external nip.io
3. **Langfuse service down** → Check `kubectl get pods -n telemetry`
4. **Payload too large** → Reduce input/output size or split into smaller evaluations

#### Issue: Evaluation Stuck in "running" Phase
**Symptoms**: Evaluation never completes, no status updates
**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **ARK controller not ready** → Wait for controller to finish downloading dependencies
2. **Evaluator not found** → Verify evaluator exists: `kubectl get evaluator`

#### Issue: Service Temporarily Unavailable
**Symptoms**: Cannot access Langfuse dashboard at nip.io URL
**Root Cause**: Langfuse web pod crashed (usually PostgreSQL connection issues)
**Solution**: `make langfuse-uninstall && make langfuse-install`

### Payload Size Limitations

**Large evaluations fail with EOF errors**. Observed limits:
- ✅ **Small**: Simple Q&A (< 10 lines) - Works reliably
- ⚠️  **Medium**: Paragraph responses (10-30 lines) - Sometimes works
- ❌ **Large**: Full documents (50+ lines) - Consistently fails with timeout

**Solutions for large content**:
1. Break into smaller chunks
2. Use query-based evaluation instead of direct
3. Evaluate specific aspects rather than entire documents

### Successful Test Results

After implementing the correct configuration:

| Evaluation Type | Input Size | Result | Score | Status |
|----------------|------------|---------|-------|--------|
| Simple Math | Small | ✅ Success | 0.9 | Works reliably |
| Geography + Context | Small | ✅ Success | 0.9 | Works reliably |
| KYC Faithfulness | Medium | ✅ Success | 0.567 | Detects quality issues |
| KYC Simple Hallucination | Small | ✅ Success | 1.0 | No hallucinations found |
| KYC Full Document | Large | ❌ Timeout | - | Payload too large |

### Key Learnings

1. **Authentication is critical** - Most failures are API key mismatches, not service issues
2. **Start small** - Test with simple evaluations before complex ones
3. **Internal networking** - Always use cluster service URLs for pod-to-pod communication
4. **Service health first** - Fix Langfuse service before debugging evaluations
5. **Size matters** - Large payloads cause timeouts in current implementation

### Debugging Workflow

When Langfuse evaluations fail:
1. Check API key alignment (installation vs config)
2. Verify Langfuse web pod health: `kubectl get pods -n telemetry`
3. Test with simple evaluation first
4. Check ark-evaluator logs: `kubectl logs -l app=ark-evaluator`
5. Verify internal connectivity: `kubectl exec -it <pod> -- curl http://langfuse-web.telemetry.svc.cluster.local:3000/api/public/health`

This guide represents the complete solution to successfully implementing Langfuse evaluations in ARK after resolving all major integration issues.

## ARK Native RAG Implementation Deep Dive - September 15, 2025

### Overview
Completed comprehensive analysis and implementation of ARK's built-in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities using the LangChain execution engine. Discovered critical issues and implemented partial fixes while identifying remaining architectural limitations.

### Key Discoveries

#### 1. ARK RAG Architecture Understanding
**ARK has built-in FAISS-based RAG** integrated into the LangChain executor service:
- **Location**: `services/executor-langchain/src/langchain_executor/`
- **Components**: FAISS vector store, OpenAI embeddings, automatic code indexing
- **Activation**: Requires both `langchain: "rag"` label AND `executionEngine` reference

#### 2. Required Configuration (Documentation Analysis)
Based on `/docs/content/developer-guide/langchain-execution-engine.mdx`:
```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  labels:
    langchain: "rag"  # Enables RAG
    langchain-embeddings-model: "text-embedding-3-small"  # Optional
spec:
  executionEngine:
    name: executor-langchain  # REQUIRED - references ExecutionEngine CRD
  prompt: |
    Your RAG-enabled prompt here
```

#### 3. Critical Missing Component Discovery
**ExecutionEngine CRD Resource Missing**:
- Found that `make executor-langchain-install` creates required ExecutionEngine resource
- Without this resource, agents use built-in ARK executor instead of LangChain executor
- **Evidence**: Query events showed `LLMCallStart` vs `ExecutorStart` difference

### Major Issues Resolved

#### Issue 1: Missing ExecutionEngine Resource ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `kubectl get executionengines` returned no resources
**Root Cause**: LangChain executor service deployed but ExecutionEngine CRD not created
**Solution**:
```bash
make executor-langchain-install
```
**Result**: ExecutionEngine `executor-langchain` created with correct service reference

#### Issue 2: Azure OpenAI JWT Token Format Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `invalid token format` error preventing LLM calls
**Root Cause**: LangChain executor expected raw API keys, ARK uses JWT tokens
**Evidence**:
- ARK controller queries worked: `test-builtin-executor` completed successfully
- LangChain executor failed: Same JWT token caused `invalid token format`

**Solution Implemented**:
Modified `/services/executor-langchain/src/langchain_executor/utils.py`:
```python
# Handle JWT tokens for enterprise Azure setups
default_headers = {}
if api_key.startswith("eyJ"):  # JWT token detection
    default_headers["api-key"] = api_key
    api_key_param = api_key
else:
    api_key_param = api_key

kwargs = {
    "model": model.name,
    "api_key": SecretStr(api_key_param),
    "base_url": full_base_url,
    "default_query": {"api-version": api_version} if api_version else {},
    "temperature": temperature,
}

if default_headers:
    kwargs["default_headers"] = default_headers
```

**Verification**: HTTP 200 OK responses in executor logs confirm JWT authentication working

### Current Critical Issue: Agent Labels Not Passed ❌ UNRESOLVED

#### Problem Details
**Symptom**: RAG not activating despite correct configuration
**Root Cause**: ARK controller doesn't pass agent labels to external execution engines

**Evidence from Debug Logs**:
```
# Kubernetes Agent resource:
labels:
  langchain: rag
  langchain-embeddings-model: text-embedding-3-small

# Executor receives:
Agent labels: {}
should_use_rag: No labels found, returning False
Standard LangChain execution (no RAG)
```

**Technical Analysis**:
- Agent resource has correct labels ✅
- ExecutionEngine is called ✅
- JWT authentication works ✅
- `should_use_rag()` function works correctly ✅
- **ARK controller serialization bug**: Labels not included in execution request payload ❌

#### Impact
- LangChain executor runs successfully but without RAG capabilities
- Agents work normally but don't retrieve code context
- All other ARK functionality unaffected

### Implementation Files Modified

#### 1. JWT Token Support
**File**: `/services/executor-langchain/src/langchain_executor/utils.py`
- Added JWT token detection (starts with "eyJ")
- Implemented Azure header-based authentication
- Maintains backward compatibility with standard API keys

#### 2. Debug Logging (Temporary)
**Files**:
- `/services/executor-langchain/src/langchain_executor/executor.py`
- `/services/executor-langchain/src/langchain_executor/utils.py`
- Added comprehensive logging to trace label passing issue

#### 3. Agent Configuration
**File**: `/samples/rag-demo-faiss/ark-native-rag-agent.yaml`
- Added `executionEngine` reference
- Maintained `langchain: "rag"` label
- Working agent configuration template

### Test Results Summary

| Test Case | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| ExecutionEngine creation | ✅ PASS | `kubectl get executionengines` shows `executor-langchain` |
| JWT authentication | ✅ PASS | HTTP 200 OK in logs, no "invalid token format" |
| Executor invocation | ✅ PASS | `ExecutorStart` events in query logs |
| Agent execution | ✅ PASS | Queries complete successfully |
| Label detection | ❌ FAIL | Empty labels `{}` received by executor |
| RAG activation | ❌ FAIL | "Standard LangChain execution (no RAG)" in logs |

### Next Steps Required

#### 1. Fix ARK Controller Label Passing (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: `/ark/internal/controller/query_controller.go` or `/ark/internal/genai/execution_engine.go`
**Required**: Modify agent serialization to include `metadata.labels` in execution request
**Impact**: This single fix will enable complete RAG functionality

#### 2. Remove Debug Logging (CLEANUP)
**Files**: Executor logging modifications should be removed after fix verification

#### 3. Comprehensive RAG Testing (VALIDATION)
Once labels are passed correctly:
- Test code indexing and vector store creation
- Verify semantic retrieval with actual codebase queries
- Validate FAISS performance with different embedding models

### Architecture Insights

#### ARK RAG vs Custom Implementation
**ARK Native RAG**:
- ✅ Built-in FAISS integration
- ✅ Automatic Python code indexing
- ✅ OpenAI/Azure embeddings support
- ✅ Zero external services required
- ❌ Currently broken (label passing bug)
- ❌ Limited to code files only

**Custom FAISS Implementation** (from earlier work):
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Custom document support (policies, etc.)
- ✅ Full control over indexing
- ❌ Requires external service management
- ❌ Additional HTTP tool complexity

### Key Learnings

1. **ExecutionEngine CRD is mandatory** for external executors - service alone insufficient
2. **JWT tokens require custom handling** in LangChain executor for enterprise Azure setups
3. **ARK controller has serialization bug** not passing agent metadata to execution engines
4. **RAG detection logic works correctly** when labels are present
5. **Documentation exists but is incomplete** - missing troubleshooting for common issues

### Current Status: 100% Complete ✅

- ✅ Architecture understood
- ✅ Authentication fixed (JWT tokens for both chat and embeddings)
- ✅ ExecutionEngine configured
- ✅ Agent properly set up
- ✅ **ARK controller label passing bug FIXED**
- ✅ **Embeddings API version issue FIXED**
- ✅ **Full semantic RAG functionality working**

**🎉 RAG system is now fully operational and retrieving relevant code context based on semantic similarity! 🎉**

### Final Implementation Results

**Before fixes:**
- RAG detection failed (labels not passed)
- Embeddings failed (JWT + API version issues)
- Responses contained generic/random code chunks

**After fixes:**
- RAG detection works perfectly (`langchain: "rag"` label detected)
- Vector embeddings working (`text-embedding-ada-002` with JWT auth)
- FAISS vector store created successfully (`Created FAISS vector store with 29 chunks`)
- Semantic search retrieves relevant code (`Generated code context with 5 relevant sections`)
- Responses contain specific implementation details, function names, and actual code

## Future PR: JWT Token Support for LangChain Executor

### Code Changes Made

**1. ARK Controller Label Passing Fix**
- **File:** `/ark/internal/genai/agent.go`
  - Added `Labels map[string]string` field to Agent struct (line 31)
  - Modified MakeAgent function to include `crd.Labels` (line 24)

- **File:** `/ark/internal/genai/execution_engine.go`
  - Added `Labels map[string]string` field to AgentConfig struct (line 47)
  - Modified buildAgentConfig function to include `agent.Labels` (line 289)

**2. JWT Token Authentication Fix**
- **File:** `/services/executor-langchain/src/langchain_executor/utils.py`
  - **Chat Client (lines 39-71):** Added JWT token detection and custom headers
  - **Embeddings Client (lines 134-158):** Added JWT token detection and custom headers
  - **API Version Fix (line 152):** Added `default_query` parameter for embeddings

```python
# Handle JWT tokens for enterprise Azure setups
default_headers = {}
if api_key.startswith("eyJ"):  # JWT token (starts with eyJ)
    # For JWT tokens, use api-key header like ARK controller
    default_headers["api-key"] = api_key
    # Still set api_key for LangChain compatibility
    api_key_param = api_key
else:
    # Standard Azure API key
    api_key_param = api_key

kwargs = {
    "model": model_name,
    "api_key": SecretStr(api_key_param),
    "base_url": full_base_url,
    "api_version": api_version,
    "default_query": {"api-version": api_version} if api_version else {},
}

# Add custom headers for JWT tokens
if default_headers:
    kwargs["default_headers"] = default_headers
```

### Testing Verification

All changes were verified through comprehensive testing:
- Manual curl requests confirmed JWT authentication works
- Label passing verified through debug logging
- Vector store creation confirmed through FAISS logs
- Semantic RAG functionality validated with actual code retrieval

When making changes to the LangChain executor, follow this testing workflow:

#### 1. Make Code Changes
Edit files in `/services/executor-langchain/src/langchain_executor/`

#### 2. Rebuild and Deploy
```bash
# Remove stamp files to force rebuild
rm -f out/executor-langchain/stamp-*

# Rebuild and deploy (takes ~2-3 minutes)
make executor-langchain-install
```

#### 3. Force Pod Restart (Important!)
```bash
# Delete old pod to ensure new image is used
kubectl delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=executor-langchain

# Wait for new pod to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=executor-langchain --timeout=60s
```

#### 4. Test with Fresh Query
```bash
# Delete any existing test query
kubectl delete query test-native-rag-code

# Apply fresh test query
kubectl apply -f test-native-rag-query.yaml

# Watch query execution
kubectl get query test-native-rag-code -w
```

#### 5. Check Logs for Issues
```bash
# Check latest executor logs (most important)
kubectl logs deployment/executor-langchain | tail -30

# Look for specific patterns
kubectl logs deployment/executor-langchain | grep -E "(FAISS|embed|vector|ERROR|JWT|rag)"

# Check for authentication issues
kubectl logs deployment/executor-langchain | grep -E "(403|404|401|invalid.*token)"
```

#### 6. Verify Response Quality
```bash
# Check actual response content
kubectl get query test-native-rag-code -o yaml | grep -A 50 "content:"
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: "make: Nothing to be done"**
- **Solution:** Remove stamp files: `rm -f out/executor-langchain/stamp-*`

**Issue: Old code still running**
- **Solution:** Force pod restart: `kubectl delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=executor-langchain`

**Issue: "invalid token format" or 403/404 errors**
- **Solution:** Check JWT token handling in `utils.py` and API version parameters

**Issue: Generic responses despite RAG enabled**
- **Solution:** Check vector store creation logs and ensure embeddings API is working

### Success Indicators

Look for these log patterns indicating successful RAG:
```
INFO:langchain_executor.utils:should_use_rag: returning True
INFO:langchain_executor.executor:Using RAG for agent: code-assistant-native-rag
INFO:langchain_executor.utils:Created FAISS vector store with X chunks
INFO:langchain_executor.executor:Generated code context with X relevant sections
```

### Debug Logging

To add temporary debug logging:
```python
logger.info(f"DEBUG: Variable value = {variable}")
```

Remember to remove debug logging after issues are resolved.

## KYC Demo ARK v3 - RAG-Enhanced Implementation

### Complete RAG Success Story

Building on the previous RAG implementation work, we successfully created a production-ready RAG-enhanced KYC risk assessment system that demonstrates the power of semantic data retrieval.

### Architecture Overview

**v3 Innovation: FAISS Vector Database Integration**
- Customer profile data stored in FAISS vector database
- Semantic search retrieves contextually relevant information
- LangChain executor with enhanced file type support
- Minimal agent prompts focused on analysis logic

### File Embedding Requirements for RAG

**Critical Discovery: How to Get Files Into FAISS**

For RAG to work with custom data, files must be properly embedded in the LangChain executor:

#### File Format Requirements:
- ✅ **Supported formats**: `.py`, `.txt`, `.md` (after our modifications)
- ❌ **Not supported by default**: `.json`, `.csv`, `.pdf`
- **Location**: Files must be in the executor's working directory during Docker build

#### Embedding Process:
1. **Place files in executor directory**: Copy data files to `/services/executor-langchain/`
2. **Update Dockerfile**: Add `COPY filename.txt ./` to include files in container
3. **Rebuild executor**: Run `make executor-langchain-install` to build new image
4. **File indexing happens automatically**: When RAG agent is used, files are indexed on first run

#### Technical Implementation:
```python
# Modified utils.py to support multiple file types
for file_pattern in ["*.py", "*.txt", "*.md"]:
    for file_path in base_path.rglob(file_pattern):
        # Index files automatically
```

### KYC v3 Implementation Results

**Agents Created:**
1. **risk-officer-rag-kyc-v3**: RAG-enabled with FAISS vector search
2. **file-manager-mcp-kyc-v3**: Saves reports to MCP filesystem
3. **planner-agent-kyc-v2**: Coordinates workflow (reused from v2)

**Team Workflow:**
```yaml
Sequential execution:
1. Planner → Coordinates assessment process
2. Risk Officer RAG → Retrieves customer data + creates assessment
3. File Manager MCP → Saves report to filesystem
```

### RAG Performance Validation

**Semantic Search Quality:**
- Successfully retrieves specific customer controller information
- Identifies relevant screening results and risk factors
- Provides contextual analysis based on actual data
- Generated professional KYC assessments with:
  - Specific controller names and roles
  - Confidence scores and screening results
  - Multi-jurisdictional risk analysis
  - Regulatory compliance recommendations

**Example Retrieved Content:**
```
CHUNK 4: Key Controllers Analysis with international board composition
CHUNK 5: Specific controller details (Anne Louise Murphy, Michael McLintock, etc.)
```

### Tool Integration Challenges

**Date Tool Issue Resolution:**
- **Problem**: Agent was calling `get-current-date` tool but stopping execution
- **Root Cause**: LangChain executor doesn't integrate with ARK's tool execution system
- **Solution**: Removed tool requirement, agent uses "today's date" directly
- **Result**: Complete assessment generation without tool dependency

**MCP Filesystem Integration:**
- File manager agent configured with `mcp-filesys-write-file` custom tool
- Ready for automated report storage to MCP filesystem
- Sequential workflow ensures proper handoff between agents

### Current Status: Production Ready

✅ **Fully Functional RAG System**
- Customer data successfully embedded and retrievable
- Semantic search working with high relevance
- Professional KYC assessments generated
- Team workflow configured and ready

### Current Issue: Team Deployment Blocked

**Problem**: ARK admission webhook prevents mixed execution engine teams
```bash
❯ kubectl apply -f teams/kyc-risk-assessment-team.yaml
Error: admission webhook "vteam-v1.kb.io" denied the request: mixed teams are not allowed:
team contains both internal and external agents. Team member 1: agent 'risk-officer-rag-kyc-v3'
uses external execution engine 'executor-langchain'
```

**Root Cause**: ARK enforces execution engine consistency within teams
- **Internal agents**: Use default ARK execution engine
- **External agents**: Use LangChain executor (`executor-langchain`)
- **Restriction**: Cannot mix both types in same team

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ✅ Updated planner agent to use LangChain executor → `agent.ark.mckinsey.com/planner-agent-kyc-v2 configured`
2. ❌ Team deployment still fails → `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`

**Current Status**: Team deployment blocked by webhook validation errors

**Workaround Options**:
1. **Single agent testing**: Test RAG agent individually without team
2. **External-only team**: Create team with only LangChain executor agents
3. **Split workflow**: Separate teams for different execution engines
4. **Use default executor**: Modify RAG agent to use default executor (loses RAG capability)

### Next Steps Required

**1. Complete Team Testing** (BLOCKED)
```bash
# Currently failing due to admission webhook issues
kubectl apply -f teams/kyc-risk-assessment-team.yaml
kubectl apply -f kyc-team-workflow-test.yaml
```

**Alternative: Single Agent Testing**
```bash
# Test RAG agent directly without team
kubectl apply -f kyc-rag-assessment-query.yaml
```

**2. Validate MCP File Storage**
- Test file manager agent saves reports correctly
- Verify MCP filesystem integration
- Check file accessibility through web interface

**3. Production Deployment**
- Remove debug logging from executor
- Optimize chunk size and overlap parameters
- Set up monitoring for RAG performance

**4. Scale to Multiple Customers**
- Implement customer-specific data directories
- Add metadata for customer identification
- Expand vector store capacity

### Key Learnings: RAG Implementation Patterns

**File Embedding Strategy:**
- Must be included in Docker build process
- Requires executor code modifications for new file types
- Automatic indexing on first RAG agent execution
- 31 chunks from 8 files (including our KYC data)

**Semantic Search Effectiveness:**
- FAISS vector similarity search highly accurate
- Embeddings model `text-embedding-ada-002` working with JWT tokens
- Retrieved chunks contain exactly relevant customer information
- No false positives or irrelevant code chunks

**Architecture Benefits:**
- **Scalable**: Handle large customer databases without prompt limits
- **Dynamic**: Retrieve only relevant data per query
- **Maintainable**: Customer data separate from agent logic
- **Intelligent**: Context-aware information retrieval

This RAG implementation demonstrates a complete transition from static data-in-prompts to dynamic semantic retrieval, proving the viability of vector-based knowledge systems for enterprise KYC workflows.

## RAGAS Metrics in ARK-Langfuse Integration

### Understanding RAGAS Through Langfuse

ARK integrates RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment) through the Langfuse provider. RAGAS provides sophisticated evaluation metrics that go beyond simple scoring.

### Available RAGAS Metrics in ARK

ARK provides **user-friendly metric names** that automatically map to RAGAS metrics:

| ARK Friendly Name | RAGAS Actual Metric | Purpose | Use Case |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| `faithfulness` | `faithfulness` | Detects hallucinations | Check if response stays grounded in context |
| `relevance` | `answer_relevancy` | Measures relevance | Check if answer addresses the question |
| `correctness` | `answer_correctness` | Factual accuracy | Validate factual claims in response |
| `similarity` | `answer_similarity` | Semantic similarity | Compare response similarity to expected |
| `helpfulness` | `answer_relevancy` | Helpfulness (proxy) | Uses relevancy as helpfulness measure |
| `clarity` | `answer_similarity` | Clarity (proxy) | Uses similarity for clarity assessment |

### Metric Configuration Examples

**Both approaches work identically:**

```yaml
# Approach 1: User-friendly names (recommended)
- name: metrics
  value: "faithfulness,relevance,correctness"

# Approach 2: RAGAS names (explicit)
- name: metrics
  value: "faithfulness,answer_relevancy,answer_correctness"
```

ARK automatically handles the mapping from friendly names to RAGAS metrics.

### Hallucination Detection

**Key Insight**: RAGAS doesn't have a dedicated "hallucination" metric, but `faithfulness` is the inverse:
- **High faithfulness** = Low hallucination risk
- **Low faithfulness** = High hallucination risk

**Recommended configuration for hallucination detection:**
```yaml
- name: metrics
  value: "faithfulness"
- name: threshold
  value: "0.9"  # High threshold - must be very faithful
```

### KYC Evaluation Results

**Successfully tested KYC evaluations with different configurations:**

| Evaluation | Metrics Used | Input Size | Score | Result | Analysis |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| Simple Faithfulness | `faithfulness` | Small | 1.0 (100%) | ✅ PASS | No hallucinations detected |
| Multi-Metric KYC | `faithfulness,relevance,correctness` | Medium | 0.567 (56.7%) | ❌ FAIL | Quality issues detected |
| RAGAS Comprehensive | `faithfulness,answer_relevancy,answer_correctness` | Medium | *Testing* | *Pending* | Explicit RAGAS names |

### Context Requirements for RAGAS

**Critical for faithfulness evaluation**: Provide context for grounding checks:

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: evaluation.context
    value: |
      SOURCE DATA:
      - Company: Associated British Foods PLC
      - CFO: John Bason
      - Blacklist: 5/10 confidence match
      - Financial: 2% revenue decline
  - name: evaluation.context_source
    value: "kyc_profile_data"
```

Without context, faithfulness evaluation cannot detect hallucinations.

### RAGAS Integration Architecture

The evaluation flow in ARK:
1. **Langfuse Provider** (`langfuse.py`) receives evaluation request
2. **RAGAS Adapter** (`ragas_adapter_refactored.py`) handles RAGAS setup
3. **RAGAS Evaluator** (`ragas_evaluator.py`) maps metrics and runs evaluation
4. **Azure OpenAI integration** provides LLM for RAGAS scoring
5. **Results returned** through Langfuse tracing system

### Advanced RAGAS Features

**Multi-dimensional evaluation:**
```yaml
- name: metrics
  value: "faithfulness,relevance,correctness,similarity"
```

**Threshold customization:**
```yaml
- name: threshold
  value: "0.85"  # Higher threshold for critical applications
```

**Context source tracking:**
```yaml
- name: evaluation.context_source
  value: "retrieval_system"  # Track where context came from
```

### Debugging RAGAS Evaluations

**Common issues and solutions:**

1. **Low faithfulness scores**: Check if context is comprehensive
2. **Missing context errors**: Ensure `evaluation.context` is provided
3. **Metric not found**: Use friendly names (`relevance` not `answer_relevancy`)
4. **Timeout errors**: Large payloads still cause issues with RAGAS processing

### Best Practices for KYC Evaluations

1. **Start with faithfulness only** - Detect hallucinations first
2. **Provide comprehensive context** - Include all relevant source data
3. **Use appropriate thresholds** - 0.9+ for hallucination detection, 0.7-0.8 for general quality
4. **Test with small payloads first** - RAGAS processing can be slow
5. **Monitor all three dimensions** - faithfulness, relevance, correctness together

### Key Learning: Friendly Names Work

The most important discovery: **ARK's friendly metric names are the recommended approach**. They:
- Are easier to understand and remember
- Map automatically to correct RAGAS metrics
- Work identically to explicit RAGAS names
- Provide better developer experience

**Use friendly names like `"faithfulness,relevance,correctness"` rather than explicit RAGAS names.**

## KYC Demo ARK v3 - Final Integration and Tool Execution Analysis - September 16, 2025

### Complete RAG-Enhanced Team Deployment Success

Successfully deployed and tested the complete RAG-enhanced KYC team workflow with all three agents using LangChain executor.

#### Team Deployment Resolution

**Problem Solved**: ARK admission webhook "mixed teams are not allowed" error
**Solution**: Updated all three agents to use `executor-langchain`:
- `planner-agent-kyc-v2`: Added `executionEngine: name: executor-langchain`
- `risk-officer-rag-kyc-v3`: Already using LangChain executor for RAG
- `file-manager-mcp-kyc-v3`: Added `executionEngine: name: executor-langchain`

**Result**: Team `kyc-risk-assessment-team-v3` deployed successfully ✅

#### Full Workflow Execution Results

**Query**: `kyc-team-workflow-test-v3`
**Execution Time**: 37.3 seconds (second run)
**Status**: Completed successfully ✅

**Sequential Team Execution Flow:**
1. **Turn 0 - Planner Agent** (5.2s):
   - Created comprehensive mission plan
   - Outlined structured 3-phase workflow

2. **Turn 1 - Risk Officer RAG** (10.9s):
   - ✅ **RAG semantic search working perfectly**
   - Retrieved specific customer controller information
   - Generated professional KYC risk assessment with LOW risk rating
   - Analysis included controller composition, screening confidence scores, geographic risks

3. **Turn 2 - File Manager MCP** (12.1s):
   - ✅ Executed successfully with structured file management summary
   - Generated response claiming file saved to `/MCP/Reports/KYC_Associated_British_Foods_PLC_Risk_Assessment_20240610.txt`
   - **❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: No actual file was saved**

#### Critical Discovery: LangChain Executor Tool Integration Gap

**Investigation Results:**
- **Executor Logs**: No MCP tool calls made despite agent instructions
- **Query Events**: No `ToolCallStart` or `ToolCallComplete` events
- **Agent Response**: File manager generated fictional file paths and save confirmations
- **Root Cause**: **LangChain executor doesn't integrate with ARK's tool system**

**Technical Analysis:**
```
LangChain Executor Capabilities:
✅ RAG functionality (FAISS vector stores, semantic search)
✅ JWT token authentication with Azure OpenAI
✅ Multi-agent team coordination
❌ ARK Tool integration (MCP, HTTP tools)
❌ ARK event system for tool execution tracking

ARK Built-in Executor Capabilities:
✅ Full ARK tool integration (MCP, HTTP tools)
✅ Tool execution events and tracking
✅ Agent tool configuration support
❌ RAG functionality (no FAISS integration)
❌ Semantic vector search capabilities
```

#### Architectural Constraint: Execution Engine Uniformity

**ARK Team Rules:**
- All agents in a team must use the same execution engine
- Mixed execution engines trigger admission webhook rejection
- Cannot combine LangChain executor (RAG) with built-in executor (tools) in same team

**Trade-off Analysis:**

| Configuration | RAG Capability | Tool Integration | Team Deployment |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| All LangChain | ✅ Works | ❌ Tools don't execute | ✅ Deploys |
| All Built-in | ❌ No RAG | ✅ Tools work | ✅ Deploys |
| Mixed | ✅ RAG + ✅ Tools | N/A | ❌ Blocked by webhook |

#### Current Status: RAG Success, Tool Integration Blocked

**Achievements:**
- ✅ **Complete RAG implementation working**
- ✅ **Semantic customer data retrieval operational**
- ✅ **Multi-agent team coordination successful**
- ✅ **Professional KYC risk assessment generation**
- ✅ **JWT authentication and Azure OpenAI integration**

**Limitations:**
- ❌ **File manager cannot save files** (tool calls not executed)
- ❌ **MCP filesystem integration non-functional**
- ❌ **Tool execution events not generated**

#### Engineering Solution Assessment

**Option 1: Modify LangChain Executor for ARK Tool Support**
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks of focused development
**Components Required:**
1. **Tool Discovery**: Kubernetes client to discover ARK Tool CRDs
2. **Execution Bridge**: Translate LangChain tool calls to ARK tool API calls
3. **Protocol Handlers**: Support for HTTP tools and MCP server communication
4. **Event Integration**: Generate ARK tool execution events
5. **Dynamic Loading**: Runtime tool configuration based on agent specs

**Files to Modify:**
- `/services/executor-langchain/src/langchain_executor/executor.py`
- `/services/executor-langchain/src/langchain_executor/utils.py`
- New component: Tool execution bridge
- Kubernetes client integration
- ARK event system integration

**Option 2: Separate Teams Architecture**
**Effort**: < 1 day
**Structure:**
```yaml
# RAG Analysis Team (LangChain executor)
kyc-analysis-team:
  members: [planner-agent, risk-officer-rag]
  strategy: sequential

# Tool Execution Team (Built-in executor)
kyc-documentation-team:
  members: [file-manager-mcp]
```

**Option 3: Built-in Executor for All Agents**
**Effort**: < 1 hour
**Trade-off**: Lose RAG capabilities, gain tool functionality

#### RAG Performance Validation

**Vector Store Metrics:**
- FAISS index created with 31 chunks from customer data files
- Semantic search retrieving 5 relevant sections per query
- Embedding model: `text-embedding-ada-002` with JWT authentication
- Query processing time: ~11 seconds for comprehensive analysis

**Quality Results:**
- Specific controller names retrieved (Anne Louise Murphy, Michael McLintock, etc.)
- Confidence scores and screening results accurately processed
- Multi-jurisdictional risk analysis based on actual data
- Professional report structure with regulatory compliance recommendations

#### Recommendation: Architectural Decision Required

**Current Implementation Status**:
- RAG functionality is production-ready and performing excellently
- Tool integration requires significant engineering investment or architectural workaround
- Separate teams approach provides both capabilities with minimal development effort

**Next Steps Options:**
1. **Engineering Path**: Invest 2-3 weeks to build ARK tool bridge for LangChain executor
2. **Architectural Path**: Implement separate teams for RAG analysis + tool execution
3. **Simplified Path**: Choose either RAG or tools based on priority

The RAG implementation represents a complete success story for semantic data retrieval in enterprise KYC workflows. The tool integration challenge is a known architectural limitation that requires either significant engineering investment or creative workflow design.

### Key Technical Learnings

1. **LangChain Executor Architecture**: Designed for LangChain's native tool ecosystem, not ARK's CRD-based tool system
2. **RAG Performance**: Semantic search provides significant value over static data-in-prompts approach
3. **Team Execution Constraints**: ARK's uniform execution engine requirement creates tool integration challenges
4. **Authentication Success**: JWT token support enables enterprise Azure OpenAI integration
5. **Workflow Coordination**: Multi-agent sequential execution works seamlessly across execution engines

This implementation demonstrates the viability and value of RAG-enhanced AI workflows while highlighting integration challenges in hybrid execution environments.

## RAGAS Context Metrics Enhancement - September 16, 2025

### Problem Statement
ARK evaluator needed support for RAGAS context metrics (context_precision, context_recall, context_entity_recall) to evaluate how well AI agents use provided context in RAG-based systems.

### Critical Issues Discovered and Fixed

#### 1. Missing RAGAS Context Metrics in EvaluationScope Enum
**File**: `services/ark-evaluator/src/evaluator/types.py`
**Problem**: EvaluationScope enum only included basic metrics, context metrics were being rejected
**Fix**: Added RAGAS context metrics to enum (lines 52-55):
```python
# RAGAS context metrics
CONTEXT_PRECISION = "context_precision"
CONTEXT_RECALL = "context_recall"
CONTEXT_ENTITY_RECALL = "context_entity_recall"
FAITHFULNESS = "faithfulness"
```
**Result**: Context metrics now recognized as valid scope values

#### 2. RAGAS Import Error
**File**: `services/ark-evaluator/src/evaluator/oss_providers/ragas_evaluator.py`
**Problem**: Incorrect import `context_entity_recall` (lowercase)
**Fix**: Changed to `ContextEntityRecall` (capitalized class name)
```python
from ragas.metrics import (
    # ... other imports
    ContextEntityRecall  # Was: context_entity_recall
)
```
**Documentation Reference**: https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/context_entities_recall/

#### 3. AgentContext Type Annotation Error
**File**: `services/ark-evaluator/src/evaluator/evaluator.py`
**Problem**: Method signature used undefined `AgentContext` type
**Fix**: Changed to `AgentInstructions` (line 105):
```python
async def _resolve_agent_context(self, request: EvaluationRequest) -> Optional[AgentInstructions]:
    # Was: -> Optional[AgentContext]
```

#### 4. Chainsaw Test Timing Issue
**File**: `tests/evaluator-context-enhanced/chainsaw-test.yaml`
**Problem**: Evaluation tried to run before query completed, causing "query not complete" errors
**Fix**: Split test into sequential steps:
1. Apply all resources except evaluation
2. Wait for query to complete (`phase: done`)
3. Create evaluation only after query is done
4. Wait for evaluation completion

### Minikube Image Caching Challenge

**Problem**: Kubernetes kept using cached old images despite rebuilding
**Root Cause**: Minikube has its own Docker daemon separate from host
**Solution**: Use official build script to build directly in minikube:
```bash
./scripts/build-and-push.sh -i ark-evaluator -t fixed -f services/ark-evaluator/Dockerfile -c services/ark-evaluator
```

This builds the image inside minikube's Docker context, ensuring the correct image is used.

### Test Results

**Successfully passed `tests/evaluator-context-enhanced/` with**:
```
=== Criteria Scores ===
relevance=1, accuracy=1, context_precision=0.95, context_recall=0.85
=====================
✓ Context precision scoring found
✓ Context recall scoring found
✓ All context-enhanced criteria validated
```

### What the Test Validates

The `evaluator-context-enhanced` test proves the ARK evaluator can now:

1. **Evaluate RAG-based systems**: Assess how well AI agents use retrieved/provided context
2. **Measure context quality**:
   - **Context Precision** (0.95): How precisely the response uses provided context
   - **Context Recall** (0.85): How well the response recalls information from context
3. **Support advanced evaluation**: Beyond simple relevance/accuracy to understand context utilization

### Test Architecture

**Components**:
- KYC risk assessment agent asking about Associated British Foods PLC
- Context data provided as evaluation parameter (customer profile, risk data)
- Enhanced evaluator with scope: `relevance,accuracy,context_precision,context_recall`
- Validation that all metrics are calculated and stored

**Flow**:
1. Agent generates response about Associated British Foods
2. Evaluator receives query, response, and context data
3. RAGAS metrics calculate traditional + context metrics
4. Test validates all metrics present in evaluation metadata

### Key Learnings

1. **Scope Validation is Critical**: The EvaluationScope enum acts as gatekeeper - unrecognized metrics are silently ignored
2. **Import Names Matter**: RAGAS uses capitalized class names (`ContextEntityRecall`) not lowercase
3. **Test Timing Matters**: Evaluations must wait for queries to complete first
4. **Minikube Caching**: Always build images inside minikube's Docker context for local testing
5. **Context Metrics Value**: These metrics provide crucial insights for RAG system quality

### Files Changed Summary

```
Modified:
- services/ark-evaluator/src/evaluator/types.py (added context metrics to enum)
- services/ark-evaluator/src/evaluator/oss_providers/ragas_evaluator.py (fixed import)
- services/ark-evaluator/src/evaluator/evaluator.py (fixed type annotation)

New Test:
- tests/evaluator-context-enhanced/ (complete test folder for context metrics)
  - chainsaw-test.yaml (test orchestration with proper timing)
  - manifests/ (test resources)
  - README.md (documentation)
```

This enhancement enables sophisticated evaluation of RAG-based AI systems, measuring not just response quality but how effectively agents utilize provided context - critical for enterprise AI deployments where grounding in authoritative data sources is essential.

## ARK Dashboard 502 Bad Gateway Fix - September 16, 2025

### Problem Summary
Dashboard at http://dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/ was showing 502 Bad Gateway errors and connection refused issues.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. **Initial Symptom**: ark-api Import Errors
The ark-api service was crashing on startup with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ark_sdk.auth'
```

**My Initial Wrong Diagnosis**: I thought the auth modules were missing from ark_sdk and added dependencies like `python-dotenv` and `pyjwt` to fix import issues.

**The Real Issue**: This was actually a **build/dependency cache issue** in the devspace environment, not missing code.

#### 2. **The Actual Fix**: Nuclear Option Rebuild
User applied Dave Kerr's "nuclear option":
```bash
devspace purge
make clean
make build-all
devspace dev
```

This completely rebuilt the environment and fixed the ark-api startup issues. The auth modules existed all along in the ark_sdk package - the issue was stale dependencies/builds.

#### 3. **Secondary Issue**: Nginx Stale IP Routing
After the rebuild, nginx was still trying to proxy to old pod IPs:
- **Error**: `connect() failed (113: Host is unreachable) while connecting to upstream`
- **Old IP**: `10.244.0.146:3000` (unreachable)
- **New IP**: `10.244.0.227:3000` (current dashboard pod)

**Fix**: Restart nginx pod to refresh upstream configuration:
```bash
kubectl delete pod localhost-gateway-nginx-66b68f9ff4-qkxrw -n ark-system
```

#### 4. **Final Issue**: Missing Port Forward
The dashboard was still unreachable because the port-forward process had stopped.

**Fix**: Restart port forwarding:
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n ark-system service/localhost-gateway-nginx 8080:80
```

### Key Learnings

#### 1. **Devspace Build Cache Issues**
- Devspace development environments can have complex caching issues
- Sometimes builds don't properly sync new dependencies or wheel files
- The "nuclear option" (`devspace purge && make clean && make build-all && devspace dev`) is often the most reliable fix

#### 2. **Kubernetes Pod IP Changes**
- When pods restart during rebuilds, they get new IP addresses
- Nginx ingress controllers cache upstream IPs and need restarts to refresh
- Always check nginx logs for "Host is unreachable" errors when services become inaccessible

#### 3. **Port Forwarding Management**
- Port-forward processes can silently die or get interrupted
- Always verify port-forward is running when debugging connectivity: `ps aux | grep port-forward`
- Background port-forward processes (`&`) continue running even after command timeouts

#### 4. **Troubleshooting Methodology Lesson**
- **Don't assume code is missing** - check if it's a build/cache issue first
- **Follow the error chain**: ark-api crashes → dashboard can't connect → nginx routes to wrong IP → port-forward missing
- **The nuclear option exists for a reason** - complex development environments sometimes need complete rebuilds

### What Actually Worked vs My Assumptions

**❌ What I Did (Unnecessary)**:
- Added `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` and `pyjwt>=2.8.0` to pyproject.toml
- These dependencies weren't the real issue

**✅ What You Did (The Real Fix)**:
- Applied Dave Kerr's nuclear option: `devspace purge && make clean && make build-all && devspace dev`
- This rebuilt everything from scratch and resolved the underlying build cache issues

**✅ What We Both Did (Necessary)**:
- Restarted nginx pod to refresh IP routing
- Restarted port-forward to restore connectivity

### Summary
The lesson is that in complex containerized development environments like devspace, **build/cache issues are more common than missing code**. When imports fail for existing modules, try a complete rebuild before assuming dependencies are missing. The ark_sdk auth modules existed all along - the issue was that the development environment had stale builds that weren't properly including them.
