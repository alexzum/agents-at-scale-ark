# Langfuse Observability for ARK Demo

This document explains what Langfuse offers for AI observability and what features are most valuable to showcase during the ARK banking demo.

---

## **What is Langfuse?**

**Langfuse** is an open-source **LLM observability & analytics platform** specifically designed for AI applications. It's like "Application Performance Monitoring (APM) for AI" - similar to how DataDog monitors microservices, but optimized for LLM applications.

### **Why Langfuse for ARK?**
- ✅ **AI-Native**: Built specifically for LLM applications (not generic APM)
- ✅ **Open Source**: Self-hostable, enterprise-friendly
- ✅ **OpenTelemetry Compatible**: Works with ARK's existing observability
- ✅ **Cost Tracking**: Monitors token usage and API costs
- ✅ **Quality Monitoring**: Tracks AI response quality and user feedback

## **Core Langfuse Features for Demo**

### **1. Trace Visualization (MOST IMPORTANT)**
**What it shows**: Complete request flow across multiple agents

```
Customer Request: "What's my balance and available loans?"
├── 🔍 Inquiry Router Agent (120ms, 15 tokens, $0.0003)
│   └── Classification: "mixed" → route to team
├── 💰 Account Helper Agent (340ms, 28 tokens, $0.0007)  
│   └── Response: "Balance: $2,450.67"
├── 🏠 Loan Advisor Agent (280ms, 31 tokens, $0.0008)
│   └── Response: "Mortgage: 6.5%, Personal: 8.9%"
└── 🤝 Team Coordinator (50ms, 12 tokens, $0.0003)
    └── Final Response: Combined customer response
```

**Demo Value**: 
- Shows the "black box" of AI interactions
- Proves performance (sub-second responses)
- Demonstrates cost efficiency

### **2. Token & Cost Analytics**
**What it tracks**:
- Token usage per agent/query
- Cost breakdown by model type
- Usage trends over time

**Sample Dashboard Metrics**:
```
Today's Usage:
├── Total Queries: 47
├── Total Tokens: 2,340 (1,890 input + 450 output)
├── Total Cost: $0.94
├── Avg Response Time: 435ms
└── Cost per Query: $0.02

Top Consumers:
├── Account Helper: $0.34 (36%)
├── Loan Advisor: $0.31 (33%)
└── Inquiry Router: $0.29 (31%)
```

**Demo Value**: 
- "See exactly what your AI costs"
- "Track ROI and usage patterns"
- "Budget and forecast AI expenses"

### **3. Quality Monitoring**
**What it monitors**:
- Response relevance scores
- Hallucination detection
- User feedback integration
- Response consistency

**Quality Metrics Example**:
```
Agent Performance (Last 24h):
├── Account Helper: 94% relevant, 0 hallucinations
├── Loan Advisor: 91% relevant, 1 factual error
└── Inquiry Router: 98% classification accuracy

Common Issues:
├── Account Helper: Sometimes provides outdated rates
└── Loan Advisor: Occasionally mentions unavailable products
```

**Demo Value**:
- "Monitor AI quality in production"
- "Catch issues before customers do"
- "Continuous improvement insights"

## **Most Valuable Demo Features**

### **Priority 1: Request Tracing (Must Show)**
**Navigation**: Traces → Recent Traces
**What to highlight**:
- End-to-end request visualization
- Performance breakdown by agent
- Token usage and costs
- Error tracking

**Demo Script**:
> "Here you can see exactly what happened when a customer asked about loans and account balance. The request went through three agents, took 750ms total, used 74 tokens, and cost $0.0018. You can drill down into each agent's decision process."

### **Priority 2: Cost Analytics (Banking Loves This)**
**Navigation**: Analytics → Costs
**What to highlight**:
- Daily/weekly cost trends
- Cost per customer interaction
- Most expensive agents/queries
- ROI calculations

**Demo Script**:
> "This shows your AI is handling customer inquiries at $0.02 per interaction. Compare that to a $15 call center interaction - you're seeing 750x cost reduction with better response times."

### **Priority 3: Performance Metrics**
**Navigation**: Analytics → Performance  
**What to highlight**:
- Response time distributions
- Throughput metrics
- SLA compliance tracking
- Bottleneck identification

**Demo Script**:
> "95% of customer queries are answered in under 1 second. You can set SLA alerts and track performance trends over time."

## **Langfuse Integration with ARK**

### **How ARK Sends Data to Langfuse**
```yaml
# ARK generates OpenTelemetry traces
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ark-observability
data:
  langfuse-endpoint: "http://langfuse:3000"
  langfuse-project: "banking-demo"
  trace-sampling: "1.0"  # 100% sampling for demo
```

### **Automatic Trace Creation**
When ARK processes a query:
1. **Span Creation**: Each agent creates a trace span
2. **Metadata Capture**: Prompt, response, tokens, timing
3. **Cost Calculation**: Based on model pricing
4. **Langfuse Export**: Via OpenTelemetry collector

### **Data Flow**

## **Demo Setup Commands**

### **Start Langfuse (if available)**
```bash
# Start Langfuse locally (Docker)
docker run --name langfuse \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/langfuse" \
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret" \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse:latest

# Or use existing ARK Langfuse integration
make langfuse-start
```

### **Configure ARK Integration**
```bash
# Enable Langfuse tracing in ARK
kubectl set env deployment/ark-api-devspace \
  LANGFUSE_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:3000" \
  LANGFUSE_PROJECT="banking-demo" \
  LANGFUSE_ENABLED="true"

# Restart to pick up new config
kubectl rollout restart deployment/ark-api-devspace
```

### **Generate Demo Data**
```bash
# Run several queries to populate Langfuse
fark agent account-helper "What's my balance?"
fark agent loan-advisor "What loans do you offer?"
fark team customer-service-team "I need my balance and loan info"

# Check data in Langfuse
echo "View traces at: http://localhost:3000/project/banking-demo/traces"
```

```bash
# If Prometheus is available
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep ark_
```

### **Dashboard Observability**
- Use ARK Dashboard's built-in Operations → Events

## **Success Criteria for Observability Demo**

✅ **Visibility**: Can see what every agent is doing  
✅ **Performance**: Response times and throughput visible  
✅ **Cost**: Token usage and cost tracking working  
✅ **Quality**: Can identify good vs poor responses  
✅ **Scale**: Metrics show system can handle production load  

The observability demo proves ARK is production-ready with enterprise-grade monitoring and cost controls that banking executives care about.
